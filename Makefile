# Makefile - template for "68k-nano" projects
#
# hardware target: 68k-nano
#
#
# REVISIONS:
# -rolf  apr 25, 2021
#       merged rim's Makefile for the CB030, with a couple others.
#       lots of futzing to get a binary that worked, esp with the 'ld' step.
#       replaced gnu as with vasm, to allow a "more readable" asm language.
#
# -roderick     apr 16, 2021
#       modified Joao Silva's Makefile to create a linked binary that can be run on the 
#       Shen.
#
# NOTES:
#  -fomit-frame-pointer
#      Omit frame pointer creation in functions that donâ€™t need it --- functions that have
#      no local variables, for example.
